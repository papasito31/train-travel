        <p class="mb-4">
            Travel Buddy NL was created to make train travel in the Netherlands more affordable, social, and fun —
            especially for students, international travelers, and budget-conscious explorers.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
            Using the NS Group Ticket system, you can travel for a much lower price when you’re part of a group.
            Travel Buddy NL helps you match with people going the same way — so you can team up, buy group tickets together, and save.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
            Our Smart Matching System shows you exact matches first, then other same-day trips you might consider.
            Even if the times aren't perfect, there's always someone going your way. 🚆
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
            Built with love by a student who was tired of paying €25 to cry in another city. ❤️
        </p>

        <p class="mt-6 font-semibold text-purple-700">Thanks for being part of the journey.  
            Let’s save together, travel smarter — and never ride alone. 💸
